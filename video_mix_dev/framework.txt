### construct interfaces for demux decode encode and mux

#### data struct

1. util: AVFrame AVPacket safequeue
2. demux and decode 
    input: filename
    process: demux, read a packet, decode it 
    output: a safequeue
3. filter and overlay
    input: safequeues of inputfiles
    process: reap frames according to frame' pts
             send to filter graph
    output: maybe output to safequeue
4. encode and mux
    input: safequeues of output frames
